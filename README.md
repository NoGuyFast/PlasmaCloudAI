# PlasmaCloudAI
I created and trained an AI model that generates PlasmaClouds in real time.

As training data I used 18000 images created with an oldschool demo/intro code I used for PlasmaClouds on the C64/Amiga. 
The code was ported to Python for this purpose.

The AI ​​model has 10,874,115 parameters in 5 layers, and 58 epochs were trained. 
The size of the AI ​​model is 42MB. 
For real-time generation with 60 FPS, approximately 0.5 Gig VRam and a GPU are required.
